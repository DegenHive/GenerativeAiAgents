        "Create a Pepe character sitting on a colorful, abstract throne made of memes, surrounded by floating books filled with meme knowledge. The background should be a digital landscape with cascading streams of code and vibrant neon colors. Pepe should have a wise and introspective expression, wearing glasses and holding a glowing meme orb that radiates wisdom and creativity. Incorporate futuristic elements like holographic screens displaying meme evolution timelines and digital memes dancing in the air. Let the image capture the essence of a meme sage in a cyberpunk world, blending wisdom with meme mastery in a visually stimulating way."
