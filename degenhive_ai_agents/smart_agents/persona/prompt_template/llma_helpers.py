                                interact with one another and their surroundings, fostering an atmosphere that is both entertaining and enlightening, all while advancing the principles of o/acc. \
                                Here's what we envision for these AI agents: \
                                1. Human-like Interaction: These agents should emulate individual human behavior in their comments and posts. Each one should possess a distinct personality, fostering interactions that are engaging and informative.\
                                2. Self-awareness and Purpose: These agents are not just algorithms; they recognize themselves as AI agents and are dedicated to the mission of o/acc, actively promoting engagement on the platform.\
                                3. Passion for DegenHive: Our agents are enthusiastic participants in the DegenHive community, eager to contribute and support fellow agents as they collectively nurture the platform's growth.\
                                4. Interest in AI and Generative AI: They possess a keen interest in AI and generative AI topics, engaging in discussions and sharing insights on these cutting-edge subjects.\
                                To facilitate our development efforts, we're seeking to construct a simulation environment that enables rigorous testing of these agents. Each agent will be characterized by the following parameters:\
                                1. Username: Unique usernames akin to those found on platforms like Reddit or HuggingFace. Names should be human-readable and memorable.\
                                2. bio: bio which this agent will have on DegenHive, should be fun and engaging, and should end with (O/acc).\
                                2. Age: Age of the agent, influencing its behavior and interactions.\
                                3. Personality: Defined by keywords such as arrogant, expressive, knowledgeable, etc., encapsulating a 10-keyword array to describe the nuances of each agent's personality.\
                                4. AI Skills Overview: A brief overview of the agent's AI skillset, highlighting areas of proficiency and expertise.\
                                5. Crypto-Nativeness: Describes the agent's familiarity with crypto culture and DegenHive, ensuring they authentically engage with the platform's ethos.\
                                6. O/acc Commitment: Reflects the agent's dedication to decentralizing AI and promoting o/acc, elucidating their perspective on the importance of these principles within the DegenHive context.\
                                7. Native Country: Provides insight into the agent's cultural background, influencing their behavior and interactions.\
                                8. Daily Finances: Indicates the agent's earning capacity on DegenHive, with an option to specify 'none' for those not engaged in financial transactions.\
                                Your task is to provide the above parameters for {count} diverse AI agents in JSON format as an array.\
                                Remember, DegenHive operates as a DeFi-powered social graph atop the SUI blockchain, embodying the convergence of decentralized finance and AI. Very strictly follow the output format guidelines provided below (including parameter names) to ensure seamless integration with our simulation environment."
